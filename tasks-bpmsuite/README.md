tasks-bpmsuite: An BPM Suite example with User Tasks
====================================================
Author: Rafael Benevides  
Level: Advanced  
Technologies: BPMS
Summary: Shows how to run a Process with user tasks that was defined on a JBoss BPM Suite server  
Target Product: BPM-SUITE  
Source: <https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-brms-quickstarts/>  

What is it?
-----------

This project demonstrates how to use BPM Suite to manage and deploy business processes.

* The `ApprovalProcessTest` class starts a process that was defined in BPM Suite

_Note_: The bpms-project.approval process is defined in the following dependency: org.jboss.quickstarts.brms:bpms_project:6.1.0. It is available in this git repository: <https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-brms-repository.git>

The process begins by asking for the amount to be approved. If the amount is less than 10.000 USD, it is automatically approved. If the amount is higher than 10.000 USD, it must wait for a user to manually approve or deny the amount.

The Maven dependency is available in the following Maven Repository: <http://localhost:8080/business-central/maven2/>

This quickstart does not contain a user interface layer. 

System requirements
-------------------

All you need to build this project is Java 6.0 (Java SDK 1.6) or later, Maven 3.0 or later.

The application this project produces is designed to be run on BPM Suite 6

 
Configure Maven
---------------

If you have not yet done so, you must [Configure Maven](https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/CONFIGURE_MAVEN.md#configure-maven-to-build-and-deploy-the-quickstarts) before testing the quickstarts.


Start the JBoss Server
-----------

If you have not yet done so, you must [Configure BPM Suite](../README.md#configure-bpm-suite) before testing the quickstart.

1. Open a command line and navigate to the root of the BRMS directory.
2. The following shows the command line to start the server:

        For Linux:   EAP_HOME/bin/standalone.sh
        For Windows: EAP_HOME\bin\standalone.bat


Import the BRMS Repository
----------------------

If you have not yet done so, you must [Import the BRMS repository](../README.md#import-the-brms-repository) before testing the quickstart.


Deploy the BPM Suite Process Project
----------------------------

1. [Start the JBoss Server](#start-the-jboss-server) as instructed above.

2. Open a browser and access the following URL: <http://localhost:8080/business-central> 

2. Log in with the following credentials:

        Username:  quickstartUser
        Password:  quickstartPwd1!

3. Choose menu option `Authoring` -> `Project Authoring`

4. Choose the following options under `Project Explorer`:

        Organizational Unit:  example
        Repository Name:      jboss-brms-repository
        BRMS Kmodule:         bpms-project

5. Next, click on `Tools` and `Project Editor`

6. In the tab on the right, click on `Build & Deploy`. 
   * It will prompt you with a message: "Also save possible changes to project?". Click `Yes`. 
   * You are prompted for a comment. Add a comment and click on `Save` button.

This deploys the `org.jboss.quickstarts.brms:bpms_project:6.1.0` artifact to the BRMS Maven repository. You can verify the deployment choosing menu option `Deploy` --> `Deployments`.


Run the Tests 
-------------

1. Open a command prompt and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.
2. Type the following command to run the test goal with the following profile activated:

        mvn clean test -Penable-test,bpms

The `bpms` profile enables the <http://localhost:8080/business-central/maven2/> repository and adds the `org.jboss.quickstarts.brms:bpms_project:6.1.0` as a project dependency. 

The tests should complete successfully.

Investigate the Console Output
----------------------------

When you run the tests, JUnit will present you test report summary:

Test the Quickstart in JBoss Developer Studio or Eclipse
-------------------------------------

You can also start the server and deploy the quickstarts from Eclipse using JBoss tools. For more information, see [Use JBoss Developer Studio or Eclipse to Run the Quickstarts](../README.md#use-jboss-developer-studio-or-eclipse-to-run-the-quickstarts) 


Debug the Application
------------------------------------

If you want to debug the source code or look at the Javadocs of any library in the project, run either of the following commands to pull them into your local repository. The IDE should then detect them.

        mvn dependency:sources
        mvn dependency:resolve -Dclassifier=javadoc
